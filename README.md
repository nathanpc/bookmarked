## Installation

First you'll have to install Qt 5. In Ubuntu you can do the following:

  > sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qt5-default build-essential

For other distros/OSes you should take a look at the [Qt website](http://qt-project.org/) or search on Google for the installation method.

Next you'll have to compile Bookmarked, it's extremely simple:

  > qmake
  > make

That's all, you should now have a executable in the folder which you can move somewhere in the `PATH`.
